# Northwind SQL Queries

This project contains a collection of SQL queries that I ran against the Northwind database, a well-known sample database used for demonstrating database concepts and functionalities.

## What is Northwind?

The Northwind database is a sample database originally provided by Microsoft, representing a trading company that deals with international product shipments. It includes several tables such as Customers, Orders, Products, Employees, and more.

## Project Details

In this project, I performed several SQL queries to explore the data stored in the Northwind database. These queries cover a variety of operations such as data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and joining tables.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have the Northwind database installed on your SQL Server instance.
2. Download the SQL script files from this repository.
3. Use a SQL client tool to connect to your SQL Server.
4. Run the queries on the Northwind database to view the results.
